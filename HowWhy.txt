What am i designing this project for 

1. To build  a truck  with various configurations.

What kind of trucks are there ?

A truck can be one of 4 types: 1.Petrol 2.Diesel 3.Hybrid 4.Electric

What are required to build a truck ?

1.Chasis 2.Engine 3.GearBox 4.Wheels 5.Capacity 6.Suspension- base model 

1.Power Drive 2.Full Digital cockpit 3.Choice of suspension - Silver

1.Paint scheme 2.chasis option 3.Silver options - Gold

What is the process to initiate a truck sign off?

1. build from factory -> goes to road test ->Factory sign off -> Safety sign off -> Sales room  - all stake holders are notified at every cycle 

How does safety sign off happen?

1. Drive within a maze 

How the Project is going to be layered 

Build
1.Single instance to get the options for construction 
2.Fluent Builder or Abstract Factory to initiate the truck build 

Test
1. Build an array to act as terrain 0 as path traversal 1 as objects
2. Truck can be navigated by use of commands North,South,West,East,Straight 
3. Best case scenario for Command Pattern?

Sign Off process?
Should follow chain of command while all the stake holders are notified should it be an observer?

Miscellaneous
Try to incorporate fascade and adapter pattern

Must

Follow SOLID
